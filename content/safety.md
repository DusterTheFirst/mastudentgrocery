# Safety Process
1. Before leaving home, wash your hands for AT LEAST twenty seconds. Also, check to make sure you are not showing any signs or symptoms of the disease before heading outside. The symptoms are listed on the CDC's webpage here.
​
2. Wear proper PPE's (Personal Protective Equipment). This includes, at the very least, facial protection and gloves. Facial protection can be either a mask, bandana or scarf; however, a mask is best if it is available.
​
3. Volunteers should practice social distancing (as outlined on mass.gov here) and physical interactions should be limited as much as possible. 
 
4. All groceries will be left at the front doorstep unless the customer says otherwise. Groceries will not be delivered inside for the safety of both parties. All groceries within the bags will be sanitized using disinfectant wipes before dropped off for the customer.
 
5. Any volunteers who are sick or have been exposed to those who are ill should not deliver (in the case of being exposed, for 14 days at least after exposure).
